In the area of lexicon-based sentiment analysis techniques, in particular, the findings are somewhat consistent with prior studies. It is generally recognised that lexicon-based techniques, such as VADER, TextBlob, and Affective Norms for English Words, are useful in a variety of text genres, including social media, reviews, and informal writing. In this study, these techniques proved to be reliable, particularly VADER and Affective Norms, which showed significant favourable sentiment percentages.
This study, however, deviated from some earlier work on deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The findings showed a large performance discrepancy, with low accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, despite the promise of deep learning models shown in sentiment analysis tasks in prior studies. This difference highlights how crucial it is to take into account variables like dataset size, variety, and domain-specific features when using deep learning for sentiment analysis tasks in technical publications.
These findings have important implications for understanding sentiment in technical publications and their practical applications. Technical content producers can use sentiment analysis to convey their content in a way that matches the required emotional tone. They can create content that more effectively connects with readers by taking into account the emotions of their audience. Sentiment analysis can be a useful tool for readers to organize their reading lists. They can use this information to decide what to read first by identifying items that are likely to be popular or contentious. Businesses that provide technical material can employ sentiment analysis to determine how well it is received by the audience. With the aid of this data-driven plan, businesses may decide on their content strategy and change their messaging in response to audience feedback.
